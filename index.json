While docker and Singularity images are stable enough to execute workflows, documentation and run scripts (shell wrappers) to run all of workflows are not ready yet for production release. Run scripts reside outside of image and (when available via user mounted disk volumes) are sourced by image entrypoint/cmd specifications at the execution of workflow.

Visit Docker page for installation and configuring Docker based workflows.\n  How to install Singularity  One time installation, requires admin privileges   Please ask your system administrator to install Singularity with following version. While installation should be done by IT administrator, running GLASS workflows does not require sudo privilege. Also, unlike potential root escalation while running docker container, Singularity based workflows are more isolated from host environment and less vulnerable to root escalation. Visit http://singularity.lbl.gov/user-guide#security-and-privilege-escalation for more on security.\n  GLASS workflows are using Singularity v2.4\n   Full version at the time of install: v2.4-install_718360bb.g718360bb\nCommit: https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/commit/718360bb20b66cbafb85dd9d0a73bd6bb60c7a1f\n  For better compatibility with pre-built GLASS image, please install Singularity from forked reposioty as follows:  umask 0022 git clone https://github.com/glass-consortium/singularity.git cd singularity ## confirm last commit ID to be 718360bb20b66cbafb85dd9d0a73bd6bb60c7a1f for HEAD -\u0026gt; master branch git log --name-status HEAD^..HEAD ## fork master branch to a new branch, named install_718360bb git checkout -b install_718360bb git status   This will show\u0026hellip;\nOn branch install_718360bb\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n ./autogen.sh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make # return exit code for compilation status echo $? ## only one time, we need root privileges sudo make install ## return to non-root user environment sudo -k cd ${HOME} # non-root user singularity --version  This will show 2.4-install_718360bb.g718360bb. If so, installation is identical to an environment used to build GLASS Singularity image.\nManual build We recommend pulling pre-built Singularity image from Singularity registry at https://www.singularity-hub.org/collections/262\nManual build is for improvement and debugging of current beta image, especially with reducing image size and adding shortcodes to additional GLASS workflows. Visit https://github.com/glass-consortium/glasstools for Singularity file and automated build details.\ngit clone https://github.com/glass-consortium/glasstools.git cd build singularity build glasstools_keystone_beta.simg Singularity.beta singularity inspect glasstools_keystone_beta.simg  Singularity image for GLASS workflows  18-Nov-2017\nv1.1.2s2\n Build details for glass-consortium/glasstools images.\nPS: Documentation to run workflows is not yet ready. Visit https://docker.glass-consortium.org for updates.\nDownload current Build singularity pull shub://glass-consortium/glasstools:beta  Automated build, when successfully built is available at Singularity Hub: https://www.singularity-hub.org/collections/262 with image tag: glass-consortium/glasstools:beta\n Download using Singularity, v2.4 or higher. Avoid running container as root. Singularity images does not require root privileges to run workflows. Default bind while running workflow is user ${HOME}. For better potability and disk mounts, ask your system admin to configure /etc/singularity/singularity.conf and set enable overlay = yes. Read http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-mount for details.  Visit Disk Mounts section for more on how to mount host disk volumes and start workflows.\nInstallation on nodes without internet access  If HPC has limited or no internet access, you can install GLASS workflows by first downloading singularity image on a different, internet-enabled machine and then moving downloaded image to machines with no internet access.  On an internet-enabled machine, e.g., login node  Following command will download singularity image with current GLASS workflows to a default singularity cache directory1. Alternately, you can specify alternate location for cache directory by environment variable SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR, i.e., one with enough space to store cache instead of user home directory.  SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/scratch/singularity/cache export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR mkdir -p \u0026quot;${SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR}\u0026quot; ## download singularity image with current GLASS workflows singularity pull shub://glass-consortium/glasstools:beta cd /scratch/singularity/cache md5sum glass-consortium-glasstools-master-beta.simg ## inspect image for version: v1.1.2s2 singularity inspect glass-consortium-glasstools-master-beta.simg   After a successful pull command, you should have a singularity image, glass-consortium-glasstools-master-beta.simg of approx. 1.3 GB size with md5sum of e3fcd575b10b6869cbf9faa5d98acdb4. If you are unable to download an image using singularity pull command, you can download an image using ftp command.  wget -P \u0026quot;${SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR}\u0026quot; ftp://ftp.jax.org/verhaak/image/singularity/glass-consortium-glasstools-master-beta.simg  On a non-internet machine, e.g., compute node  Please note that nodes with non-internet access must have singularity software installed using installation steps above. This is not required in most cases as login and compute nodes are on shared file system, and hence, singularity command and downloaded GLASS image on an login node can be accessed by all of compute nodes.\n Create a singularity cache directory to store downloaded GLASS workflows image\n  SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/scratch/singularity/cache export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR mkdir -p \u0026quot;${SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR}\u0026quot;   Copy singularity image over local area network (LAN) connection from an internet-enabled machine (www-node) to non-internet node (lan-node)  rsync -avhP www-node:/scratch/singularity/cache/ lan-node:/scratch/singularity/cache/ ## image can be renamed mv glass-consortium-glasstools-master-beta.simg glasstools_keystone_beta.simg ## inspect image cd \u0026quot;${SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR}\u0026quot; singularity inspect glasstools_keystone_beta.simg   Inspect log for v1.1.2s2  { \u0026quot;WEBSITE\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://docker.glass-consortium.org\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.bootstrap\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;docker\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MAINTAINER\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Samir B.

When you enable host user mapping (recommended), docker container will create on-the-fly new user without any root privilege and map its UID and GID to that of current user running docker run or as defined via -e HOSTUSER= argument. With valid user mapping to a non-root, regular user on the host system, docker container will be able to read-write files only at mounted host data volumes under disk1/glasscore, disk1/scratch and disk2/glassdata. This is true as long as host user has permissions to write and recurse in directories at these locations. Such host user mapping restricts privilege escalation while running docker container which can otherwise adversely impact host file system.
