      <description>Glioma Longitudinal AnalySiS Consortium Old homepage
This website hosts how-to manuals for running various analysis pipelines for the GLASS consortium.
We are moving to Singularity based workflows for better compatibility with academic IT infrastructure. You can now download and try beta build of Singularity image at https://github.com/glass-consortium/glasstools
Both Docker and Singularity images are near identical with a few changes in ENTRYPOINT and CMD specifications. While docker and Singularity images are stable enough to execute workflows, documentation and run scripts (shell wrappers) to run all of workflows are not ready yet for production release.</description>
